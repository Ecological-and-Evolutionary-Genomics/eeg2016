# Here is the actual abstract of the project: Climate warming is inducing rapid large-scale changes in the boreal biome due to permafrost thaw. Soil nutrients and microbial processes could mediate the effect of permafrost thaw on plant community dynamics. Most plant species associate with soil microbes. These plant associated microbes facilitate resource uptake and may be a key indicator of climate feedback. The plant hosts are also known to influence their microbes in a variety of ways. During the crop domestication process, we often select upon the ability to provide high yield across varying environments. This also includes the hidden soil microbial environments below the surface. When comparing a domesticated line to one of wild ancestry, the domesticated plants may have lost a certain degree of host control and symbiont choice to shape their microbiomes. Wild type hosts could be more successful than their domesticated counterparts when selecting on environmentally obtained microbiomes, implying that wild lines are potentially better suited for microbiome engineering. This unexplored area of microbiome engineering research has tremendous implications on the implementation and interpretation of future experiments investigating the impact of soil microbes on plant fitness. Here, we compared measures of plant fitness among both an inbred and a natural ecotype of Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with Alaskan microbial communities from a permafrost thaw gradient. We contrast the differences in the hostâ€™s capacity to incorporate the soil microbes as well as how the soil community differs across the treatments. Understanding the natural diversity of soil microbes within a landscape and how they change across plant history and genetics will help us better utilize and plan for future crops. Future microbiome evolution experiments will shed light on how we can best manipulate the extremely complex relationships plants have with soil microbes.
