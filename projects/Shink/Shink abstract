Arctic Lamprey: Parasite or Predator?

Documenting predator/prey interactions is essential to help build our understanding and guide our management of marine ecosystems. 
The Bering Sea is an important and complex ecosystem that supports both commercial and subsistence fisheries. The overarching goal 
of this study is to improve our understanding of the Bering Sea ecosystem by characterizing lamprey feeding ecology and the role 
of lamprey as predators. To accomplish this goal, evaluations have been initiated to (1) characterize the diet of marine-phase 
Arctic lampreys, (2) assess if predation varies with body size or location, and (3) compare trophic interactions inferred from the 
visual observations of lamprey scars on prey fishes and gene sequence-based identification of prey species. 
I hypothesize that Arctic lampreys are (1) generalist predators in marine ecosystems, (2) that diet is influenced by both location 
and specimen size, and (3) gene sequenced-based identification of prey species will reveal previously undocumented lamprey predation of 
prey species. The application of molecular species identification, specifically next generation sequencing of target diagnostic 
genes, will be used to characterize the diet of Arctic lampreys. The results from this research will inform researchers and 
management agencies about the ecosystem roles and interactions between Arctic lamprey and prey species.

*With my current dataset I cannot analize if predation varies with body size, location, etc. because my PCR products are not dual
indexed. I will be able to give a general characterization of lamprey diet and provide a brief comparison of prey identification
methods. My current dataset consists of 80 pooled individuals collected in 2014.
