Project description:

Broadening the scope of knowledge on Arctic marine microbial communities is imperative as a warming climate 
and subsequent alterations to environmental parameters become increasingly apparent. Environmental drivers 
(e.g., temperature, salinity, and nutrient composition/availability) strongly influence the community structure 
and microbial denizens within. The Arctic Ocean system is influenced by the inflow of both Atlantic and Pacific 
water masses, each bringing with them distinguishable physical and chemical properties. As climatic change progresses, 
the marine environments of the Arctic are projected to face increased temperatures, decreased salinities, and intensified 
stratification with the upshot leading to shifts in diversity and distribution of extant microbial communities. This study 
will assess the composition and phylogenetic diversity of microbial communities in the Arctic Ocean, focusing on the Barents 
and Chukchi Seas. By means of next-generation sequencing approaches, I will employ targeted-amplicon sequencing of both the 
16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes for prokaryote and eukaryote inhabitants, respectively. Differences in phylogenetic diversity 
of Arctic marine microbial communities will be analyzed parallel to a suite of environmental drivers. In addition to an 
assessment of abiotic influences, relationships between microbial members within the communities will be examined as structural 
drivers themselves. As the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas are some of the most sensitive ecosystems on Earth in the face 
of climactic change, it is important to garner extensive information on this region as changes continue to develop – this 
includes having a better understanding of it’s microbial biodiversity. Accordingly, this project aims to shed light on the 
diversity of bacterial, archaeal, and protist communities within the Arctic Ocean.

For the purposes of this class, only Barents Sea data will be analyzed.
