# 1. Go to your home directory (/home/yourname).
cd

# 2. Make a new directory called 'exercise1'.
mkdir exercise1

# 3. Go to new directory.
cd exercise1

# 4. Download the file 'ex1.txt' from Github using the following command:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rec3141/eeg2016/master/exercise1/ex1.txt

# 5. Preview the file 'ex1.txt'.
head ex1.txt

# 6. Count the number of lines in 'ex1.txt'.
wc -l ex1.txt

# 7. Sort 'ex1.txt' by sequence identifier and save the output to a new file called 'seqs.sort.fa'.
sort -n ex1.txt > seqs.sort.fa

# 8. The syntax to read 'file.txt' line by line and do something with each line is shown below. 
# This example echoes, or prints out, each line, followed by a blank line, and appends each to 
# a file called 'newfile.txt':
#    while read myline; do
#       echo $myline >> newfile.txt
#       echo "" >> newfile.txt
#    done < file.txt

# Use the construction above to output each line of 'seqs.sort.fa' two times, with each line 
# separated by a blank line, and save everything to a new file called 'seqs.dup.fa'.
while read myline; do
	echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
	echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
done < seqs.sort.fa

# 9. Output the non-blank lines from 'seqs.dup.fa' and dereplicate them into a new file 
# called 'seqs.uniq.fa'.
### REC/ PUTTING THIS IN A LOOP IS UNNECESSARY AND CAUSES THE FILE SEQS.DUP.FA TO BE GREP'D FOR EVERY LINE
### REC/ WHICH MEANS THAT THE OUTPUT FILE HAS 33800 LINES INSTEAD OF 130

#while read myline; do
	grep -v "^$" seqs.dup.fa > seqs.nonblank.fa
#done < seqs.dup.fa

### REC/ UNNECESSARY USE OF LOOP
### REC/ UNIQ REQUIRES SORTED LINES
#while read myline; do
	sort -u seqs.nonblank.fa > seqs.uniq.fa
#done < seqs.nonblank.fa

# 10. Count the number of unique DNA sequences in the file 'seqs.uniq.fa' and output 
# the value to a file in your home directory called 'ex1-answer.txt'.

### REC/ THIS DOES NOT COUNT THE UNIQUE DNA SEQUENCES, IT COUNTS THE UNIQUE HEADERS

wc -l < seqs.uniq.fa > /home/brian/ex1-answer.txt


# 11. Delete all of the files that have names beginning with 'seqs'.
rm seqs*

# 12. Delete the folder 'exercise1' and everything inside of it.
cd ..
rm -rf exercise1
