#Biol 697 Exercise 1. Ian Charold Herriott.
#1. Go to your home directory.
cd

#2. Make a new directory called exercise1.
mkdir exercise1

#3. Go to the new directory.
cd exercise1

#4. Download the file ex1.txt from Github using the following command: on linux: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rec3141/eeg2016/master/exercise1/ex1.txt 
wget https://raw.githuberusercontent.com/rec3141/eeg2016/master/exercise1/ex1.txt

#5. Preview the file ex1.txt.
head -15 ex1.txt

#6. Count the number of lines in ex1.txt.
wc -l ex1.txt 

#7. Sort ex1.txt by sequence identifier and save the output to a new file called seqs.sort.fa
sort -k1 ex1.txt > seqs.sort.fa

#8. Use the construction [given] to output each line of seqs.sort.fa two times, with each line separated by a blank line, and save everything to a new file called seqs.dup.fa.
while read myline; do
  echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo $myline >> seqs.dup.fa
  echo "" >> seqs.dup.fa
done < seqs.sort.fa

#9. Output the non-blank lines from seqs.dup.fa and dereplicate them into a new file called seqs.uniq.fa.
sort -u seqs.dup.fa > seqs.uniq.fa 
##This results in 66 seqs. 1 too many.

#10. Count the number of unique DNA sequences in the file seqs.uniq.fa and output the value to a file in your home directory called ex1-answer.txt
cut -f2 seqs.uniq.fa | wc -l >ex1-answer.txt
#This results in a count of 55. 1 too many, because of a blank line at top I don't know how to get rid of. 

#11.Delete all of the files that have names beginning with seqs.
rm -f seqs.* 

#12. Delete the folder exercise1 and everything remaining inside of it.
cd..
rm -f -r excercise1/
